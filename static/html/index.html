        Moe Kyuniversity is an SRS tool for learning Japanese. It takes inspiration from Anki, and uses the precious
        Wanikani
        data to create a custom SRS system.

        Search for a vocabulary word you want to learn, and Moe Kyuniversity uses the Wanikani data to figure out what
        kanji
        and radicals you need to learn before you can learn the vocabulary. Now you are not confined to the word
        learning order that Wanikani have chosen.
